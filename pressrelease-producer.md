# Events by independent Perth producers - ALL IN ONE PLACE!

Event-WOO

A place for independant Perth producers to register their events without relying on social media.

21 June 2021

---

Event-WOO is allowing independant producers/ promoters and performing artists to have their events known in a space, separate to social media, in a world that is dominated by big ticketing corporations.

In a safe, inclusive space; producers are protected from having their events removed from social media due to unnecessary censorship. Producers are also able to view other events in order to gauge suitability for location and dates for their events.

Additionally, Event-WOO will offer analytics to allow further analysis of foot-traffic and gauge event popularity.

This web app will be developed by a new upcoming company called The Serotonin Seekers - a company with the goal of improving your lives in whatever small way they can.

### Testimonals

"As a new producer, I have found it really hard to navigate social media when promoting my Basement Burlesque shows. I have had friends who don't use social media miss out on my events because they were only advertised on social media, and not everyone used social media as much as I do! Using Event-Woo I am able enter the details of my event and know that there are more people viewing my event. I also don't have the risk of my show being censored on Event-Woo, as Event-Woo is run by open-minded humans and doesn't have the algorithms that favours thin white cisgendered people." 

***-Ida Ocean, Producer of Basement Burlesque Presents***

Background on topic/area

With one of us being an independent burlesque performer we found that it is extremely difficult to make yourself known when holding small-independent events. Most events are advertised by big ticketing corporations that have budgets that far exceed that of a independent producer and thus make it near impossible to reach a wider audience.

Summarise: Who & What 

Event-WOO plans to make the lives of independant producers easier! What ever the event is from burlesque, drag, small-music concerts or even seminar/webinars. Post your event, search for events and view analytics of your event all in one place. Forget about social media!

With plans to launch on the 22 June 2021 - If successful, the app will be available to producers outside of Perth.
