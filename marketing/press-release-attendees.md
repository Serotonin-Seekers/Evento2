### *Testimonials*

"I live in Northam and like to come down to Perth on the weekends, but I was finding it hard to find events without having to search through a series of clicks. I also don't have social media and found it really hard to find events through a google search.

Event-WOO was so easy to use, the information for events came up with one click. I can filter by date and what I want to see!

I can now come to Perth and know what local, independent events are on easily, without the hassle!

Background on topic/area

Trying to find a LOCAL, INDEPENDENT event to attend can be quite challenging, especially for those of us who just want to browse events to see what is on. Currently, there's a heavy reliance on social media to find event information. When you do not want to use social media looking for these LIVE events sends you down a rabbit hole of clicks and opening new tabs to websites, having to put in your details when all you want to do is see what is on.   

Sometimes we want to find something on a certain date because friends from out of town are visiting, or we really feel like going to a Drag show, or want to know what small indie bands are playing on the weeekend!
