## Description ##


The Velvet Soap Box is a website where independent producers, promoters and artists can list their event, and people who love to go to events can browse local independent events. 


## Usage ##


Independent producers, promoters and artists create an account on The Velvet Soap Box. Once they have created an account, they are able to log into their account. Once logged in they then select the "add event" option on the Events drop down button. There, they are taken to a page where they enter the details of the event. Once the event details are entered, they can submit event. They can then view events, found also on the Events drop down button. There they are taken to a page that displays all the events that have been listed. You can then click the event and view the details of the event, where you will find a link to the ticketing website. 
People who are looking for an event to attend can browse the events listed without creating an account. 


## Challenges ##


We have struggled to impliment the sessions where logging in stores a cookie. When logging out, there is no loggedIn property to refer to. We also have to update the styling.
